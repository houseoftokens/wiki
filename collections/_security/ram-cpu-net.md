# Resources Management

Users are required to stake resources to gain the right to manage HOT.

## RAM

RAM refers to the storage status. RAM would be spent during HOT name bidding, etc. RAM transaction actually is staking HOT to system account instead of a real transaction between seller and buyer. Buy RAM=Stake HOT; Sell RAM=Reduce Stake HOT

## CPU and NET

CPU&NET is two kinds of bandwidth of HOT account to restrict the blockchain resources each HOT account can use. All the transaction of HOT blockchain requires CPU&NET resources. The more tokens you have staked towards CPU and NET, the more access you have to system resources. Different from RAM, HOT stake for bandwidth would be refunded back to the available balance in 72 hours after unstaking.
