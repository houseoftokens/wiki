# Account Security Settings

## Passwords

### Login password

Login password is used when user logging in. 

If you forget your login password, you can get it back at [Find my password](https://www.hotwallet.tech/resetpwd/email).

We will send the instructions to your email registered with your account.

### Payment password

Payment password is used to confirm some operations you made, for example, making transfer transactions, trading, etc.

you can not reset your payment password without mobile phone bound or Google Authenticator activated.

So we recommend you bind mobile phone or activate your Google Authenticator.

## Mobile phone

If you bind a mobile phone, when you login, you'll be asked to input the random code which is sent to your phone through SMS. This will make your account more secure.

We recommend you finish your ID verification after binding mobile phone. For security reason we can not let you modify your phone number online, customer with ID verification approved can request our customer service staff to help doing this. 

If your ID verification is approved, you can send the following documents to our email `support@hotwallet.tech` to change a new phone number:

1. Your account nick, your old phone number.
2. Your ID images of both sides.
3. An image contains your face and holding your identity with front side.
4. New phone number.

## Google Authenticator

If you activate Google Authenticator, when you login, you'll be asked to input the random code which is generated by the Google Authenticator App. This will make your account more secure.

If you have a phone bound at the same time, Google Authenticator has first priority.

For more information, please check [Google Authenticator](gauth)
